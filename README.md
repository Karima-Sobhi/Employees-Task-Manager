# Employees-Task-Manager
The Businessman wishes to get an application that helps his employees to manage their tasks 
,enhance the way of managing the tasks by prioritising them & to track the tasks.
Implement a C++ program that helps them manage their tasks list so as to be able to follow 
up what's done & what's not.

### The program should allow the employee to: 

1. Reading the employeeâ€™s tasks (Task Title, Description, Assigning date, Required ending 
date, Name of Employee the task assigned to & with priority values (1:10 , meaning 1 least 
important and most important)).

2. Creating a Priority List/Queue.
3. Sort the list descendingly according to priority, so that the most important task is on the 
top.
